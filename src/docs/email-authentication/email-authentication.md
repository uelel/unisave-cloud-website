This template lets you quickly add email and password authentication of your players into your game. Make sure you read the [authentication](authentication) documentation page first.

> ðŸš§ This module has gone through a complete make-over in January 2023 so the old documentation can be completely discarded. I'm about to write the new one, should be here soon.

The module is used in very much the same way as the [Epic Authentication](../epic-authentication/epic-authentication.md) module. To get started, explore the `Assets/Plugins/Unisave/Examples/EmailAuthentication` example scene that comes with the Unisave asset. Also, this module need not be installed, just enabled - it comes with the Unisave asset as well.
