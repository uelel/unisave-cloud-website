  terms and conditions of service (collectively with Privacy Policy, located at <a

  3 of these Terms of Service.</p>

<h3>Agreed Use of Allotted Resources</h3>
<p>2.7 Subscribers shall not use any method to circumvent the provisions of these Terms of Service, or to obtain

  the amount of resources assigned to them through the Services, or to conceal such activities.</p>

  following guidelines for including removal links with all sent emails according to the such legislation. Subscribers
  shall comply with all laws regarding the sending of commercial electronic messages or other marketing or electronic
  communications. Subscribers are forbidden from taking any action that would result in their IP addresses, or any IP

  sole and absolute right to determine whether an email violation has occurred.</p>

<h3>Invasion of Privacy, Defamation, or Harassment</h3>

  Unisave's sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<h3>Violation of Copyright, Trademark, Patent or Trade Secret</h3>
<p>2.11 Subscribers may not use the Services in violation of the copyrights, trademarks, patents or trade secrets of
  third parties, nor shall they utilize the Services to publish such materials in a manner that would expose them to
  public view in violation of the law. Unisave will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of repeat
  violators. If a third party believes that a Subscriber of Unisave is violating its intellectual property rights, it
  should notify us by email. A notification should include information reasonably sufficient to permit Unisave to locate
  the allegedly infringing material.</p>

<h3>Sub-Users</h3>
<p>2.12 Subscribers are responsible for the acts of others utilizing their access to the Services, and will be held
  responsible for violations of the Services by their sub-users or persons who gain access to the Services using the

  breach.</p>

<h2>3. Third Party Services</h2>
<p>3.1 The Services may permit you to link to other websites, services or resources on the Internet, and other websites,
  services or resources may contain links to the Services. When you access third party resources on the Internet, you do
  so at your own risk. These other resources are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible
  or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or
  resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply our endorsement or any association between us and their
  operators. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for
  any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content,
  goods or services available on or through any such website or resource. It is your responsibility to protect your
  system from such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature.</p>

<h2>4. Payments and Billing</h2>
<h3>Acceptable Payment Methods</h3>
<p>4.1 Unisave accepts major credit cards and debit cards. Virtual credit cards and gift cards typically will not be
  accepted. Other forms of payment may be arranged by contacting Unisave at the email address specified at the end of
  this Agreement. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for paid
  Services are deemed part of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.2 We use third-party payment processors (the "Payment Processors") to bill you through a payment account linked to
  your Account on the Services (your "Billing Account") for use of the paid Services. The processing of payments may be
  subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processors in addition to this Agreement. We are
  not responsible for error by the Payment Processors. By choosing to use paid Services, you agree to pay us, through
  the Payment Processors, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such paid Services in accordance with
  the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processors, to charge your chosen payment
  provider (your "Payment Method"). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right
  to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>

<h3>Billing and Terms</h3>
<p>4.3 The term of this Agreement shall be monthly, to commence on the date that the Subscriber signs up electronically
  for the Services by creating an Account with an email address. All invoices are denominated, and Subscriber must pay,
  in the currency specified on the invoice. The preferred currency is U.S. Dollars unless a different agreement is made.
  Subscribers are typically billed monthly on or about the first day of each month, with payment due no later than ten
  (10) days past the invoice date. On rare occasions, a Subscriber may be billed an amount up to the Subscriber's
  current balance in an effort to verify the authenticity of the Subscriber's account information. This process ensures
  that Subscribers without a payment history are not subjected to additional scrutiny. For specific pricing policies,
  please refer to <a href="/pricing">https://unisave.cloud/pricing</a>. Monthly fees and renewal fees will be billed at
  the rate agreed to at purchase. You may cancel the Services at any time by logging into your account at <a
    href="/login">https://unisave.cloud/login</a> or by sending an email. At cancellation, your Account will be
  inactivated and you will no longer be able to log into our site and/or have any access to the Services. Except in the
  case of subscription commitments you have agreed to, which shall be nonrefundable, as permitted by law, if you cancel,
  you agree that fees for the first month of Services and any start-up costs associated with setting up your Account
  ("Start-up Costs") shall be nonrefundable, as permitted by law. With the exception of any subscription commitments
  agreed by you, if you paid fees in advance for any period longer than one month, then you may, with the exception of
  fees for the first month of Services and any Start-up Costs, obtain a refund on a pro rata basis for the period
  remaining after you cancel.</p>
<p>4.4 YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE
  ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS,
  CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSORS IF YOUR
  PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS
  THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING
  INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT
  UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>
<p>4.5 Subscriber is responsible for any duties, customs fees, taxes, and related penalties, fines, audits, interest and
  back-payments relating to Subscriber's purchase of the Services, including but not limited to national, state or local
  sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes (VAT) and goods and services taxes (GST) (collectively, "Taxes"). Unisave's
  standard pricing policies do not include and are not discounted or enhanced for any such Taxes. If Unisave becomes
  obligated to collect or pay Taxes in connection with Subscriber's purchase of the Services, those Taxes will be
  invoiced to that Subscriber as part of a billing process or collected at the time of purchase. In certain states,
  countries and territories, Unisave may determine if Subscriber's purchase of Services is subject to certain Taxes, and
  if so, may collect such Taxes and remit them to the appropriate taxing authority. If Subscriber believes that a given
  tax does not apply or that some amount must be withheld from payments to Unisave, Subscriber must promptly provide
  Unisave with a tax certificate, withholding receipt, tax identifier (e.g., VAT ID) or other adequate proof, provided
  such information is valid and sufficiently authorized by all appropriate taxing authorities. Subscriber must also
  provide Unisave with any tax identification information that is necessary for Unisave to comply with Unisave's tax
  obligations, as determined by Unisave from time to time. Subscriber will be solely responsible for any
  misrepresentations made or non-compliance caused by Subscriber regarding Taxes, whether with respect to Unisave or
  other parties, including any penalties, fines, audits, interest, back-payments or further taxes associated with such
  misrepresentations or non-compliance. Other specific tax policies are described in Unisave's Tax Information page,
  which is incorporated by reference herein. </p>

<h3>Arrearages</h3>
<p>4.6 Payments not made within ten (10) days of invoicing will be deemed in arrears. For accounts in arrears, if any
  amount is more than ten (10) days overdue, without the requirement of providing notice of such arrears, Unisave may
  suspend service to such account and bring legal action to collect the full amount due, including any attorneys' fees
  and costs.</p>

<h3>Suspension for Nonpayment</h3>
<p>4.7 If a Subscriber is past due on their balance, Unisave may send up to three (3) email notifications within a
  fifteen (15) day period before suspending the Subscriber's account. Services will be temporarily disabled for the
  Subscriber during the suspension period. Unisave reserves the right to delete the Subscriber's account with all the
  associated information, code, and data after the final termination notice.</p>

  at any time, with or without notice, effective immediately, including but not limited to as a result of your violation
  of any of these Terms of Service or any law, or if you misuse system resources, such as, by employing programs that
  consume excessive network capacity, CPU cycles, or disk IO. Any such termination may result in the forfeiture and
  destruction of information associated with your Account. Unisave may provide prior notice of the intent to terminate
  Services to you if such notice will not, in Unisave's discretion, run counter to the intents and purposes of these
  Terms of Service. Except as otherwise set forth hereunder, any and all fees paid hereunder are non-refundable and any
  and all fees owed to Unisave before such termination shall be immediately due and payable, including any liabilities
  that may have been incurred prior to termination such as Unisave's costs for collection (including attorneys' fees) of
  any such charges or other liabilities. Upon termination, any and all rights granted to Subscriber by this Agreement

  terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Website or through the Services. All
  provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
  including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

<h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>12.1 Mindful of the high cost of litigation, you and Unisave agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: in

  Agreement; (iii) the Services; (iv) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement; or (v) any
  other dispute between you and Unisave ("Dispute"), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good faith to
  settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the
  facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days
  in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent (1) if to Unisave: at the contact address specified
  at the end of this Agreement or (2) if to you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping
  address in your Account information. Both you and Unisave agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition
  precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.</p>

<h2>13. Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>13.1 Neither you nor Unisave shall be liable for nonperformance of the terms herein to the extent that either you or
  Unisave are prevented from performing as a result of any act or event which occurs and is beyond your or Unisave's
  reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, unrest or riot, strikes, any action of a
  governmental entity, weather, quarantine, fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, utility or telecommunications outages,
  Internet disturbance, or any unforeseen change in circumstances, or any other causes beyond either party's reasonable
  control. The party experiencing the force majeure shall provide the other party with prompt written notice thereof and
  shall use reasonable efforts to remedy effects of such force majeure.</p>
<p>13.2 You are granted a limited, non-exclusive right to create a hypertext link to the Website found at <a
    href="https://unisave.cloud/">https://unisave.cloud/</a>; provided such link does not portray Unisave and/or its
  affiliates or any of their respective products and services in a false, misleading, derogatory or otherwise defamatory
  manner. This limited right may be revoked at any time. You may not use, frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose
  any Unisave trademark, logo or other proprietary information, including the images found at the Website, the content
  of any text or the layout/design of any page or form contained on a page without Unisave's express written consent.
  Except as noted above, you are not conveyed any right or license by implication, estoppel, or otherwise in or under
  any patent, trademark, copyright, or proprietary right of Unisave or any third party.</p>
<p>13.3 This Agreement, including all related agreements and policies incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the
  entire agreement between the parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous
  agreement between the parties relating to the Services. A valid waiver hereunder shall not be interpreted to be a
  waiver of that obligation in the future or any other obligation under this Agreement. The failure of either party to
  exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. In
  order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice
  of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives. If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law
