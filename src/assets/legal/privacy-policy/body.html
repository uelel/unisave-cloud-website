</ol>
<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</h2>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal
  information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to
  perform a contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your
  rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and
  communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving
  our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the
  personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you,
  we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is
  mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<h2>5. Third-party Services</h2>
<p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party
  services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these
  third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.</p>
<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>Unisave is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and
  measures designed to protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are
  designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However,
  please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for
  example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting
  requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
  anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
  archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
  deletion is possible.</p>
<h2>8. Access</h2>
<p>If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our
  Services or by emailing info@unisave.cloud. If you terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior
  to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or
  removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to
  backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access
  and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit Unisave's ability
  to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit Unisave's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in
  disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade
  secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to Unisave or a third party.</p>
<h2>9. Your Data Protection Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you wish to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any
    time by emailing info@unisave.cloud.</li>
  <li>In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of
    your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights
    by emailing info@unisave.cloud.</li>
  <li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by
    clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of
    marketing, please contact us by emailing info@unisave.cloud.</li>
  <li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw
    your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted
    prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
    lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
  <li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal
    information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance
  with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<h2>10. Your Choices</h2>

  we collect.</p>
<p>You may unsubscribe from receiving certain promotional emails from us. If you wish to do so, simply follow the
  instructions found at the end of the email. Even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational,
  transactional, account-related, or similar purposes.</p>
<p>Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies, which may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or
  enable selective use of cookies. Please note that, if you choose not to accept cookies, some features and the
  personalization of our Services may no longer work for you. You will continue to receive advertising material but it
